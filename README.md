# Zoo Builder

Explore the world, gather materials, collect animals, grow food, and build your zoo.

# TODO

The tasks below are "minimum implementations" of basic, core features in the game. The idea is that if you can
change a few settings, then you can easily add more, and if you can create a simple quest line, you can easily
add more.

Actual storyline details, specific features or game mechanics will be added afterwards.

## Player

- ✅ Player character, controllable with WASD + Space, can jump
- ✅ Character animation when moving
- ✅ 3D camera movable with mouse

- Some kind of cursor/highlighted grid square (maybe just when holding specific tools?)

## Menu
